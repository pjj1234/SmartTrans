# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install all deps | `npm run install:all` |
| Dev (server :28123 + web :5173) | `npm run dev` |
| Dev server with auto-restart | `npm --prefix server run dev:watch` |
| Typecheck both | `npm run typecheck` |
| Rebuild RAG vector store | `npm run rag:ingest` |
| Production build (frontend → `web/dist`) | `npm run build` |
| Start server in production | `npm start` |
| Test API endpoints | `npm --prefix server run test:api` |

**server scripts** (run from `server/`): `npm run dev` (tsx), `npm run dev:watch` (tsx watch), `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit), `npm run rag:ingest`, `npm run test:api`
**web scripts** (run from `web/`): `npm run dev` (vite), `npm run build`, `npm run preview`, `npm run typecheck` (vue-tsc)

## First-Time Setup

```bash
npm run install:all
cp server/.env.example server/.env   # then edit: fill in API keys for vision/reasoning/embedding models
npm run rag:ingest                   # build vector store from server/data/knowledge/
npm run dev                          # starts server:28123 + web:5173 concurrently
```

For production deployment, copy `server/.env.production.example` instead (adds `LOG_LEVEL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).

## Architecture

```
Express (server/src/index.ts)
  ├─ POST /api/analyze        ← SSE stream of multi-agent pipeline stages
  ├─ GET/POST /api/reports/*   ← CRUD on analyzed reports (SQLite)
  ├─ GET/POST /api/knowledge/* ← RAG knowledge base search, upload, & stats
  ├─ GET|POST|DELETE /api/mcp/* ← MCP connection management & agent tool binding
  ├─ GET|POST|DELETE /api/skills/* ← Skills CRUD, agent-skill bindings, provider caps
  ├─ GET /api/health
  └─ Static: /uploads/* (uploaded images), web/dist/* (prod SPA fallback)

Vue 3 SPA (web/src/) — Element Plus component library + vue-i18n
  ├─ AnalyzeView   ← upload images + text, watch SSE progress, see final report
  ├─ HistoryView   ← browse past reports with detail dialog
  ├─ KnowledgeView ← search legal knowledge base, upload/delete documents
  ├─ McpSettingsView ← manage MCP connections + per-agent tool enablement (lazy-loaded)
  └─ SkillsView    ← manage Skills + per-agent enablement (lazy-loaded)
```

During dev, Vite proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to `http://localhost:28123` (matching the server's default `PORT`). In production, Express serves `web/dist` directly.

## i18n System

The entire system supports three languages: **en**, **zh-CN**, **zh-TW**. The frontend sets a `language` field in the `/api/analyze` multipart request, which flows through every agent and into PDF generation.

- **Frontend** (`web/src/i18n/`): `vue-i18n` with `createI18n` (legacy: false). Locale persists to `localStorage` key `smarttrans-language`. A `LanguageSwitcher.vue` component lets users switch. Element Plus locale is synced via `element-locales.ts`.
- **Server** (`server/src/i18n/index.ts`): All agent system prompts, user prompts, step labels, and PDF labels are stored in `Record<SupportedLanguage, string>` maps. Two universal helpers are appended/prepended to every agent call:
  - `LANGUAGE_ENFORCEMENT` (appended to system prompt) — a critical rule requiring all text fields in the target language
  - `LANGUAGE_PREFIX` (prepended to user prompt) — a language reminder at the top of each user message

## Multi-Agent Pipeline (server/src/agents/orchestrator.ts)

The pipeline runs sequentially via an async generator that yields `StageEvent`s over SSE:

1. **Vision Agent** (`Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct`) → scene description (vehicles, road, weather, signals)
2. **Severity Agent** (`DeepSeek-V4-Flash`) → minor/moderate/severe + injury/property assessment
3. **Liability Agent** (`DeepSeek-V4-Flash` + RAG) → fault percentages per party + cited legal articles
4. **Report Agent** (`DeepSeek-V4-Flash`) → structured accident report with recommendations

Each agent receives: (a) **MCP tools** pre-fetched by `mcpManager.getToolsForAgent(agentName)` — one call per agent before the pipeline runs, (b) **Skills** injected via `skillsManager.getSkillsForAgent(agentName, skillSelections)` — merged from persisted agent-skill bindings and per-request user selections, and (c) **language-specific prompts** from `server/src/i18n/index.ts` (system + user prompts in the target language, plus `LANGUAGE_ENFORCEMENT`/`LANGUAGE_PREFIX`).

Each agent is implemented as a separate file (`vision.agent.ts`, `severity.agent.ts`, `liability.agent.ts`, `report.agent.ts`), all calling the shared `generateStructured()` helper.

All agent outputs are validated against Zod schemas (`schemas.ts`). On completion, the report is persisted to SQLite via `insertReport()` and a PDF is generated (best-effort, failure is non-fatal).

### Structured Generation (server/src/agents/helpers.ts)

`generateStructured()` is the central helper used by all four agents. It uses a **single-stage** `generateText()` call with both `tools` and `output: Output.object({ schema })` combined:

- **Without tools**: `generateText({ output: { schema }, stopWhen: stepCountIs(1) })` — equivalent to `generateObject`
- **With MCP tools**: `generateText({ tools, output: { schema }, stopWhen: stepCountIs(10) })` — tool calls and structured output in one pass, capped at 10 steps

This single-stage approach avoids the double latency of the old two-phase pattern (generateText → generateObject).

## RAG System (server/src/rag/)

- **Knowledge corpus**: Markdown files in `server/data/knowledge/` (traffic law excerpts), plus runtime-uploaded documents via the web UI
- **Chunking** (`chunk.ts`): Article-aware — detects `第X条` markers and splits by article; falls back to sliding window (500 chars, 80 overlap)
- **Embedding** (`ingest.ts`): Batch CLI using `embedMany()` with Qwen3-Embedding-8B (4096 dims)
- **Storage** (`store.ts`): `better-sqlite3` + `sqlite-vec` virtual table (`vec_kb_chunks`) for vector similarity search. Runtime uploads go through the same embed→insert flow via the knowledge routes
- **Retrieval** (`retriever.ts`): Embeds query → KNN on vec0 table → returns top-k chunks with source/article metadata

Rebuild the vector store after changing knowledge files: `npm run rag:ingest`. Individual documents can also be uploaded/deleted at runtime via `POST/DELETE /api/knowledge/documents`.

**Liability agent guardrail**: If RAG returns no results, `citedArticles` is programmatically cleared to `[]` and a disclaimer is added to the system prompt instructing the model not to cite articles from its own knowledge.

## MCP System (server/src/mcp/)

Model Context Protocol integration allows agents to call external tools during analysis:

- **Manager** (`manager.ts`): Singleton `McpManager` — maintains a map of MCP client connections, handles connect/reconnect/disconnect lifecycle, provides `getToolsForAgent(agentName)` to aggregate tools from all enabled connections for a given agent. When MCP is disabled, returns `{}`.
- **Store** (`store.ts`): Persists connection configs (`mcp_connections` table) and per-agent enablement settings (`agent_mcp_settings` table)
- **Types** (`types.ts`): `McpConnectionConfig` (transport: http/sse/stdio), `McpConnectionStatus`, `AgentMcpSetting`
- **Routes** (`routes/mcp.routes.ts`): `GET/POST/DELETE /api/mcp/connections`, `GET/PUT /api/mcp/agent-settings`, `GET /api/mcp/status`

MCP is gated by the `MCP_ENABLED` env var (defaults to `false`). When disabled, all `/api/mcp/*` routes (except `/status`) return 404 and agents run without external tools.

**Tool name disambiguation**: When two MCP connections expose tools with the same name, the second is prefixed with `connectionName__` to avoid collisions (`manager.ts` line 152).

### Preset System Connections

Preset MCP connections are seeded on startup by `McpManager.seedPresets()`, cannot be deleted by users, and show a "系统" badge in the UI. They are marked with `is_system = 1` in the `mcp_connections` table.

**PDF报告生成器** (`system-pdf-generator`): Exposes `generate_report_pdf` — takes `reportJson` string, generates a styled PDF via pdfkit, stores to `server/data/pdfs/`. Has a local fallback executor: if the stdio MCP client fails to connect, the manager runs `generatePdf()` directly without going through the MCP transport.

## Skills System (server/src/skills/)

Skills are domain-knowledge packs that can be injected into agent system prompts. Each Skill is a directory under `server/data/skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown body (`instructions`), plus optional bundled files.

- **Parser** (`parser.ts`): Reads `SKILL.md` from disk, extracts frontmatter with a hand-rolled YAML parser (supports `key: value` and `key: |` multi-line), reads any bundled files alongside `SKILL.md`
- **Manager** (`manager.ts`): Singleton `SkillsManager` — maintains an in-memory cache of parsed skills, seeds preset system skills on startup, provides `getSkillsForAgent(agentName, selections?)` which merges persisted agent-skill bindings with per-request user selections
- **Store** (`store.ts`): Persists skills to the `skills` table and agent bindings to `agent_skill_settings` table
- **Inject** (`inject.ts`): `formatSkillForSystemPrompt()` wraps skill content in `[Skill: name]...[/Skill: name]` boundary markers and appends to the agent's system prompt
- **Routes** (`routes/skills.routes.ts`): `GET/POST/DELETE /api/skills/:id`, `PUT /api/skills/:id/enabled`, `GET/PUT /api/skills/bindings/agent-settings`, `POST /api/skills/upload-bundle`, `GET /api/skills/meta/provider-capabilities`

### Preset System Skill

One preset skill is seeded on startup by `SkillsManager.seedPresets()`:

**liability-enhancer** (`system-liability-enhancer`): Provides detailed liability determination guidance — fault assessment criteria, common accident-type responsibility splits (rear-end, lane-change, intersection, pedestrian, etc.), multi-vehicle chain analysis method, and special circumstances (force majeure, emergency避险, 好意同乘). Default-bound to the `liability` agent.

System skills are marked `is_system = 1` and cannot be deleted via the API.

### Skill Prompt Injection Format

Skills are appended to the agent's system prompt with clear boundary markers:

```
--- BEGIN SKILLS ---
[Skill: liability-enhancer]
Description: ...
Instructions: ...
[/Skill: liability-enhancer]
--- END SKILLS ---
```

## PDF Report Generation (server/src/pdf/generator.ts)

After the multi-agent pipeline completes and the report is persisted, the orchestrator generates a PDF automatically (best-effort, failure is non-fatal). PDFs are stored at `server/data/pdfs/report-<uuid>.pdf` with a `pdf_path` column in the `reports` table tracking the file.

- **Library**: `pdfkit` (A4, 50pt margins, styled sections with serif/sans-serif font pairing)
- **Fonts**: Priority order — (1) custom fonts in `server/data/fonts/` (SourceHanSansSC + SourceHanSerifSC in Regular/Bold), (2) system fonts (Windows: SimHei/SimSun/KaiTi; macOS: PingFang/STHeiti; Linux: Noto Sans CJK/WenQuanYi)
- **Download**: `GET /api/reports/:id/pdf` streams the PDF with `Content-Disposition: attachment`
- Frontend shows a "下载PDF" button in HistoryView only when `hasPdf` is true

## Database (server/src/db/)

SQLite via `better-sqlite3` with WAL mode + `sqlite-vec` extension. File: `server/data/app.db`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reports` | Completed analysis reports (JSON columns + pdf_path for optional PDF download) |
| `kb_documents` | Knowledge base document metadata |
| `kb_chunks` | Text chunks with article number references |
| `vec_kb_chunks` | Virtual table (vec0) — float[4096] embeddings for vector search |
| `mcp_connections` | MCP server connection configs and status (includes `is_system` flag) |
| `agent_mcp_settings` | Per-agent MCP tool enable/disable flags for each MCP connection |
| `skills` | Skill metadata (name, description, source_path, is_system, enabled, provider_ref, upload_status) |
| `agent_skill_settings` | Per-agent skill enable/disable bindings (UNIQUE on agent_name + skill_id) |

The DB layer (`server/src/db/index.ts`) uses safe migrations: on startup it checks `PRAGMA table_info()` for missing columns (`pdf_path`, `is_system`, `enabled`) and adds them if absent. All data directories (`uploads/`, `knowledge/`, `pdfs/`, `fonts/`, `skills/`) are created on first launch.

## AI Model Configuration (server/src/config.ts + providers/index.ts)

All three models go through SiliconFlow's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Three separate providers are created via `createOpenAICompatible` — one per model class — to allow different keys/endpoints per model. See `server/.env.example` for all env vars.

## Deployment

- **Linux/macOS**: `bash deploy.sh` — installs deps, builds frontend, rebuilds RAG, starts via PM2
- **Windows**: `.\deploy.ps1` — installs deps, builds frontend, rebuilds RAG, prints manual start instructions
- **PM2 config**: `ecosystem.config.cjs` — runs `tsx src/index.ts` from `server/`, port 28123, auto-restart (max 10), 500MB memory limit, logs to `logs/`

## Upload Middleware (server/src/middleware/upload.ts)

- **Analysis images**: `upload.array('images', 6)` — max 6 files, 15MB each, image MIME types only
- **Knowledge documents**: `uploadKnowledge.single('file')` — max 1 file, 5MB, `.md`/`.txt`/`.markdown` only

Uploaded files are stored in `server/data/uploads/` with random UUID filenames.
